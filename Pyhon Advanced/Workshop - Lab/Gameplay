A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of their "1" into the center column of an empty game board. 
The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their numbers at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with "2", achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game. 
If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.
